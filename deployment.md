Platform as a Service, also known as PaaS, is a cloud computing service model that acts as a foundation for technical developers to do everything from building to management of their applications. It has many built-in tools for software (and other) development as well as for service hosting over the internet. It performs like a layer between IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS, Software as a service, and allows users to make heavily customized applications.

In Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, also known as CI/CD, PaaS includes tools for debugging, code editing, and pipeline management. Many of the various PaaS platforms support automated workflows like CI/CD, which helps with continuous monitoring and updating. PaaS also can automate the deployment process for the platform being built, and can streamline efficiency, speed, scalability, and reduce operational overhead.

There are an abundance of valuable aspects about the role PaaS can play in CI/CD. Communication PaaS, or CPaaS, offers pre-built frameworks that enable developers to add real-time communication capabilities to their applications. Mobile PaaS, MPaaS, acts similarly for mobile application setup.

Lastly, PaaS's cost model is unique. PaaS uses a consumption, pay-as-you-go pricing model that charges based on computing resources users use. This, in addition to their dynamic resource allocation helps to reduce waste and optimize resource utilization.
